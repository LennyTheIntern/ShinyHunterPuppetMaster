Certainly! Shiny hunting in the original Pokémon Fire Red doesn't have as many methods as in the later games, but it can still be done. The odds of finding a shiny Pokémon in these games is 1 in 8192 without any methods to increase those odds like in later titles. Here's a step-by-step guide to shiny hunt for a Charmander:

Starting a New Game:

Boot up Pokémon Fire Red.
Select "NEW GAME" to start from the beginning.
Playing Until You Choose a Starter:

Go through the introductory dialogue with Professor Oak.
Choose a name and gender for your character.
Proceed through the game until you get to Professor Oak's lab. This is where you will choose your starter Pokémon.
Checking Charmander:

When you're at the point of choosing a Pokémon from the three Poké Balls on the table, save your game. This is essential, as you'll be resetting many times.
Choose Charmander. After selecting it, you will have a chance to nickname it. Even if you don't nickname it, you will be taken to a menu screen that shows its summary.
Look at Charmander's sprite. A shiny Charmander is a golden-yellow instead of the regular orange. If the Charmander you chose isn't shiny, you'll have to reset and try again.
Resetting:

If the Charmander isn't shiny, perform a soft reset. On a Gameboy Advance, you can do this by pressing A + B + Start + Select simultaneously.
After the game reboots, load your save and choose Charmander again. Check if it's shiny.
Repeating:

Continue to reset and check Charmander until you get a shiny one. Remember, the odds are 1 in 8192, so this could take a while. Be patient!
After Obtaining Shiny Charmander:

Once you have your shiny Charmander, you can continue playing the game as normal, with the added bonus of having a rare shiny Pokémon!
Tips:

While this method is simple, it is also time-consuming. The process could take hours or even days, depending on your luck.

It's helpful to get into a rhythm or routine, especially during the repetitive nature of shiny hunting. For instance, get into the habit of quickly resetting once you see the Charmander isn't shiny.

Some players like to keep count of how many times they've reset, either as a way to stay motivated or just to know the effort it took once they finally get their shiny.

Good luck with your shiny hunting!
